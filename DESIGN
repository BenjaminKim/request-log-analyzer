Request-log-analyzer is set up like a simple pipe and filter system.

This allows you to easily add extra reports, filters and outputs.

1) Build pipeline.
                             -> Aggregator  (database)
  Source -> Filter -> Filter -> Aggregator  (summary report)
                             -> Aggregator  (...)

2) Start chunk producer and push chunks through pipeline.
  Controller.start
3) Gather output from pipeline.
  Controller.report
