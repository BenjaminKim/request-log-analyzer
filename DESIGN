Request-log-analyzer is set up like a simple pipe and filter system.

This allows you to easily add extra reports, filters and outputs.

1) Build pipeline.
                             -> Aggregator  (database)
  Source -> Filter -> Filter -> Aggregator  (summary report)
                             -> Aggregator  (...)

2) Start chunk producer and push chunks through pipeline.
  Controller.start

3) Gather output from pipeline.
  Controller.report

At the moment the supported sources are file and STDIN.
In the future we want to be able to have a generated request database as source.
This will make interactive downdrilling possible.


For the report generation output we now use the File and the STDOUT class, as they both support <<.
In the future we want to have a OutputFile, OutputSTDOUT and OutputHTML class, so that reports can generate
tables, lines and comments and push them into the output class.
