Request-log-analyzer is set up like a simple pipe and filter system.

This allows you to easily add extra reports, filters and outputs.

1) Build pipeline.
                             -> Aggregator  (database)
  Source -> Filter -> Filter -> Aggregator  (summary report)
                             -> Aggregator  (...)

2) Start chunk producer and push chunks through pipeline.
  Controller.start

3) Gather output from pipeline.
  Controller.report

At the moment the supported sources are file and STDIN.
In the future we want to be able to have a generated request database as source.
This will make interactive down drilling possible.

For report generation output can output to STDOUT and HTML.
