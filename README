Rails log analyzer
--------------------------------

This is a simple command line tool to analyze Rails log files. Its purpose is to find what 
actions are best candidates for optimization.

This tool will parse all requests in the Rails logfile and aggregate the information. Once 
it is finished parsing the log file, it will show the requests that take op most server 
time. Different metrics are used (cumulative time, average time, blockers, DB time, etc)
