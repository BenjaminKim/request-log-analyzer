h1. Request-log-analyzer

This is a simple command line tool to analyze request log files of both Rails and
Merb to produce a performance report. Its purpose is to find what actions are best candidates for optimization.

* Analyzes Rails log files (all versions)
* Can combine multiple files (handy if you are using logrotate)
* Uses several metrics, including cumulative request time, average request time, process blockers, database and rendering time, HTTP methods and states, Rails action cache statistics, etc.) ("Sample output":http://wiki.github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer/sample-output)
* Low memory footprint (server-safe)
* Fast
* MIT licensed
